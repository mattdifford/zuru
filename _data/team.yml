    Having cut his teeth in the white-hot media world of the late 90s, Ben is renowned throughout the industry as a high-flying marketing leader with real commercial bite.


    He's held top positions at the biggest names in the business. Accumulated media spends in excess of £500 million at unprecedented rates. And delivered the disruptive rocket the marketing landscape needed in 2009, founding Virtuoso Advertising, one of the UK's first performance-based digital agencies – sending it soaring into the top 10 independent agencies in just its first year of trading.


    Following a successful sale of the business to Zeta Global, he helped the newly evolved company grow to a valuation of over $1 billion and become one of the world's largest privately owned digital technology businesses.

    PepsiCo, Peugeot, Carlsberg, Logitech and many more. They've all seen their performance boosted, bolstered and brought bang up to date thanks to the specialist skills and sharp-edged marketing savvy that James brings to the table.


    Joining Ben early on in the success story at Virtuoso, he was also a key part of the international expansion at Zeta Global, forging a formidable partnership that remains the envy of the performance marketing world today.


    By the end of 2012 Virtuoso was dominating the market place and was successfully sold to Zeta Global. James then took on the role of Vice President of Zeta Global's performance marketing divisions. Over the next 3 years increased growth helped them achieve a valuation of over USD1 billion and remain one of the world's largest privately owned digital technology companies.

    A business development specialist with a passion for performance and a fearless willing to tackle challenges head on, Marc launched his career in the media industry alongside Ben and James at Zeta Global in 2014.


    The impact he made was felt immediately, as he played a pivotal role in extending and enhancing the Group’s external media capabilities in the UK, before turning his attention to Zeta’s London-based sales team and taking charge of a client base with revenues running into seven figures.


    Not content with this whirlwind beginning to his professional life, Marc left Zeta to develop formidable skills in data security and processing. And in the pre-GDPR era, he applied his expertise to the gambling sector, working in close collaboration with the industry’s governing body to develop (literally) game-changing technology.
