  At Zuru, we don't just go out there and find audiences for you. We're constantly building our own, giving you a ready-made pool of hyper-engaged prospects to target.


  Through our LifeSOS brand, we're deepening our understanding of what consumers need, and when they need it, across all aspects of their lives. By harnessing the growing power of artificial intelligence, we're redefining customer acquisition, based on what people actually need, rather than cost alone.


  Two further platforms – Raize and The Clubhouse – give you direct access to high-value, ever-engaged audiences drawn from the flourishing worlds of sport, social media, eSports and online gaming. 


  With an innate understanding of each of these prospect groups, we're able to focus more sharply on what's going to work with them, delivering real-time engagement and more effective organic customer acquisition for you.
